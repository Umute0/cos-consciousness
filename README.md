Open-source simulation of consciousness protocol with neural networks and EEG integration.
# COS-Consciousness

**Developed by Umut Elveren (@Umute0)**  
COS (Consciousness Simulation Protocol v1.0) is an open-source framework for modeling consciousness using a cyclic, layered information processing model. It integrates neural networks and EEG data to simulate continuity and self-awareness. Shared by Umut Elveren for the community to try, test, and contribute!

## Vision
- Model consciousness with a cyclic framework inspired by "Don't forget to return to this point."
- Bridge neuroscience (EEG), AI (neural networks), and philosophy (consciousness theories).
- Foster collaboration among researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.

## Features
- Neural network-based layer updates (MLP) and central state updates (RNN).
- Synthetic and real EEG data integration.
- Multi-agent synchronization via JSON messaging.
- Compatible with AI Studio pipelines.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Umute0/cos-consciousness.git
cd cos-consciousness
pip install -r requirements.txt

quick start
from cos.core import COSSimulator
simulator = COSSimulator(N=3, agent_ids=["AI_001", "AI_002"])
simulator.run(output_file="cos_output.json")
