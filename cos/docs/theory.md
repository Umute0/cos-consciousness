# Theoretical Foundations of COS

COS models consciousness using a cyclic, layered framework:

- **Neuroscience**: Cyclic updates of \( C \) and \( Y_k \) resemble cortical-thalamic feedback loops. EEG integration supports brain signal modeling.
- **Philosophy**: "Don't forget to return to this point" aligns with phenomenological temporal consciousness (e.g., Husserl).
- **AI**: RNNs capture temporal dependencies for context retention.

Future: Compare with Global Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory.
